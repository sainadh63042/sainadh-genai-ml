Certainly, exploring numerical patterns can be both fascinating and educational, especially when you're applying machine learning techniques to predict the next numbers in sequences. Here are several numerical patterns, each with its unique rule. You can use these patterns to test your model's ability to learn and predict:

### Pattern 1: Linear Growth
**Rule**: Start with 2, and add 3 each time.
- Sequence: 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, ...

### Pattern 2: Quadratic Growth
**Rule**: Start with 1, and add successive odd numbers (which is equivalent to \(n^2\)).
- Sequence: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, ...

### Pattern 3: Exponential Growth
**Rule**: Start with 2, and double it each time.
- Sequence: 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, ...

### Pattern 4: Fibonacci Sequence
**Rule**: Start with 0 and 1, then each next number is the sum of the previous two.
- Sequence: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, ...

### Pattern 5: Alternating Sign Sequence
**Rule**: Start with 1, and multiply by -3 each time.
- Sequence: 1, -3, 9, -27, 81, ...

### Pattern 6: Prime Numbers
**Rule**: Sequence of prime numbers.
- Sequence: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, ...

### Pattern 7: Factorial
**Rule**: \(n!\) where \(n = 0, 1, 2, ...\)
- Sequence: 1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, ...

### Pattern 8: Triangular Numbers
**Rule**: \(n(n + 1) / 2\)
- Sequence: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, 21, ...

### Pattern 9: Square Numbers
**Rule**: \(n^2\)
- Sequence: 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, ...

### Pattern 10: Cube Numbers
**Rule**: \(n^3\)
- Sequence: 1, 8, 27, 64, 125, 216, ...

These patterns vary in complexity from linear to more unpredictable sequences like the prime numbers. When using these patterns to train and test your model, consider the nature of the pattern and whether a simple neural network model can capture its underlying rule. Some patterns, especially those that grow rapidly or irregularly (like prime numbers), may pose a significant challenge and could require more sophisticated models or feature engineering to predict accurately.
